# Flicker photo stream

This app allows users to display Flicker photo stream from the public API.

Users can search items by tags too.

A safe tag has been added for the search functionality to ensure the application remains suitable for all ages.

The app uses Tachyon CSS classes for better performance.

A router had been implemented in case it is needed in the future.
